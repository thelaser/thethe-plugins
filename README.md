# thethe-plugins

These are plugins for [Th3Th3, a cybersec intel tool.](https://github.com/ElevenPaths/thethe)

I will try to make a pull request at some point with this code, but for now I don't feel like it.

To make these plugins work, one should add the Python files in the backend corresponding code, and the same with the Vue files.

## For the Vue files

Copy the folders with the plugin name to the path

`thethe/thethe_frontend/src/components/templates` 

## For the Python files

Copy the files to the path below

`thethe/thethe_server/server/plugins`

I know following these intructions to add functionality to an app is not really cool.. but life is hard. 

Like a spoonful of rocks. 

What can I say..!

(I am sorry. But not too much.)
